# Static in C++

In C++, the keyword `static` can be used with variables and functions inside and outside classes. It has different meanings depending on the context, but in general, it means that the variable or function exists independently of any object or instance. Letâ€™s break down its usage:

---

## 1. Static Data Members (Static Variables) in a Class

A static data member is a member of a class that is shared among all instances of the class. Unlike regular member variables, which are specific to each object, a static data member is common to all objects of the class.

### Key Characteristics of Static Data Members:
- They belong to the class itself, not to individual objects.
- They are shared across all instances of the class.
- They are initialized outside the class definition.
- They are accessible without creating an object of the class (via the class name).

### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
public:
    static int count;  // Declaration of static data member

    MyClass() {
        count++;  // Increment the static member count for each object created
    }
};

// Initialization of static data member outside the class definition
int MyClass::count = 0;

int main() {
    MyClass obj1;
    MyClass obj2;
    MyClass obj3;

    // Accessing the static data member using the class name
    cout << "Number of objects created: " << MyClass::count << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Line-by-Line Explanation:
- `static int count;`: Declares a static data member `count` inside the class. This variable is shared among all instances of `MyClass`.
- `MyClass::count = 0;`: The static data member must be defined and initialized outside the class. This allocates memory for the static variable.
- `count++;`: Increments `count` every time a new object is created. Since `count` is static, it is shared by all objects, so each object creation increases the same `count` variable.
- `MyClass::count`: Accessing the static member variable using the class name, without the need for any object.

## 2. Static Member Functions in a Class

A static member function belongs to the class, not to any particular object. This means:
- It can be called without creating an object.
- It can only access other static members of the class (both static data members and other static member functions).
- It does not have access to the `this` pointer because it is not tied to any specific object.

### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
private:
    static int count;  // Static data member
public:
    MyClass() {
        count++;  // Increment static member count
    }

    // Static member function
    static int getCount() {
        return count;  // Can only access static members
    }
};

// Define and initialize static data member
int MyClass::count = 0;

int main() {
    MyClass obj1;
    MyClass obj2;

    // Call the static member function without creating an object
    cout << "Total objects created: " << MyClass::getCount() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## 3. Static Local Variables in Functions

A static local variable inside a function retains its value between function calls. Unlike normal local variables that are destroyed when the function exits, static local variables are initialized once and persist for the lifetime of the program.

### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void exampleFunction() {
    static int count = 0;  // Static local variable
    count++;
    cout << "Function called " << count << " times" << endl;
}

int main() {
    exampleFunction();
    exampleFunction();
    exampleFunction();
    return 0;
}
```

## 4. Static Global Variables

A static global variable (when declared outside a function) limits the scope of the variable to the file in which it is declared. This is useful for encapsulation in multi-file projects.

### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

static int count = 0;  // Static global variable

void incrementCount() {
    count++;
}

int main() {
    incrementCount();
    incrementCount();
    cout << "Count: " << count << endl;  // Output: Count: 2
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 5. Static Functions (File Scope)

A static function declared outside a class or function restricts its visibility to the file in which it is declared. This is used to limit the function's scope in large projects.

### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

static void display() {
    cout << "This is a static function with file scope." << endl;
}

int main() {
    display();
    return 0;
}
```

## Summary of Static Keyword in C++
| **Usage**                       | **Description**                                                                         |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Static Data Members (Class)**  | Shared by all instances of the class. Accessed with the class name.                     |
| **Static Member Functions**      | Belong to the class, not objects. Can be called without creating an object.             |
| **Static Local Variables**       | Retain their value between function calls. Initialized only once.                       |
| **Static Global Variables**      | Scope limited to the file they are declared in.                                         |
| **Static Functions (File Scope)**| Limits the function's scope to the file where it is declared.                           |

## Key Takeaways:
- Static members (variables/functions) are tied to the class, not individual objects.
- Static local variables persist across function calls.
- Static global variables are limited in scope to the file they are declared in.
- Static functions with file scope cannot be accessed from other files.
- The `static` keyword is useful for managing memory efficiently and controlling the scope and lifetime of variables and functions in C++.
