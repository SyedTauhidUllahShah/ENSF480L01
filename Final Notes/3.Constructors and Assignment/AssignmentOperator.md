# Assignment Operator Overloading in C++

The assignment operator (`=`) in C++ is used to assign one object to another. By default, the compiler provides a shallow assignment operator that copies all member variables from one object to another. However, if a class contains dynamically allocated memory, you need to overload the assignment operator to ensure proper handling, especially to avoid memory leaks and double deletion issues.

Overloading the assignment operator allows you to control how one object is assigned to another when both objects have already been created.

## Default Behavior of Assignment Operator
The default assignment operator performs a shallow copy, meaning it simply copies the member variables as is, which can lead to problems when dealing with dynamic memory. For example, both objects will point to the same memory, which could lead to memory leaks or double deletion.

## Syntax of Overloaded Assignment Operator
The overloaded assignment operator must:

- Return a reference to the current object (`*this`) so that assignments can be chained.
- Check for self-assignment (i.e., avoid assigning an object to itself) to prevent unintentional side effects.
- Delete any previously allocated memory to avoid memory leaks when replacing the contents of the current object.
- Perform a deep copy of dynamically allocated memory, if needed.

Here is the syntax:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass &obj);  // Overloaded assignment operator
};
```

## Example of Assignment Operator Overloading with Deep Copy

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
private:
    int *data;  // Pointer to dynamic memory
public:
    // Parameterized constructor
    MyClass(int value) {
        data = new int(value);  // Allocate memory dynamically
        cout << "Parameterized constructor called. Value: " << *data << endl;
    }

    // Copy constructor for deep copy
    MyClass(const MyClass &obj) {
        data = new int(*(obj.data));  // Allocate new memory and copy the value
        cout << "Copy constructor called. Copied value: " << *data << endl;
    }

    // Assignment operator overloading
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass &obj) {
        // Check for self-assignment
        if (this != &obj) {
            // Free existing memory
            delete data;

            // Allocate new memory and copy the value
            data = new int(*(obj.data));
            cout << "Assignment operator called. Assigned value: " << *data << endl;
        }

        // Return the current object to allow chaining
        return *this;
    }

    // Destructor to release allocated memory
    ~MyClass() {
        delete data;  // Free the dynamically allocated memory
        cout << "Destructor called." << endl;
    }

    // Function to display the value
    void display() const {
        cout << "Value: " << *data << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1(10);  // Parameterized constructor
    MyClass obj2(20);  // Parameterized constructor
    
    obj2 = obj1;  // Calls the overloaded assignment operator
    
    obj1.display();  // Should display 10
    obj2.display();  // Should display 10 (deep copy)
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Line-by-Line Explanation:
- `int *data;`:
  - Declares a pointer to dynamically allocated memory that will store an integer value.
  
- `MyClass(int value):`
  - Parameterized constructor that dynamically allocates memory for `data` and initializes it with the value provided (`new int(value)`).
  
- `MyClass(const MyClass &obj):`
  - The copy constructor performs a deep copy by allocating new memory for `data` and copying the value from `obj.data`. This ensures that the new object has its own memory.
  
- `MyClass& operator=(const MyClass &obj):`
  - This is the overloaded assignment operator:
    - **Self-assignment check**: `if (this != &obj)` prevents an object from being assigned to itself (e.g., `obj1 = obj1;`). Without this check, the object could delete its own data before copying it, leading to errors.
    - **Delete old memory**: `delete data;` frees the memory that was previously allocated for the current object. Without this step, dynamically allocated memory from previous assignments would be lost, causing a memory leak.
    - **Deep copy**: `data = new int(*(obj.data));` allocates new memory for `data` and copies the value from the source object (`obj`). This ensures that `data` in both objects points to different memory locations.
    - **Return `*this`:** Returning the current object (`*this`) allows chained assignments, such as `obj1 = obj2 = obj3;`.

- Destructor (`~MyClass()`):
  - The destructor is responsible for releasing the dynamically allocated memory when the object is destroyed, using `delete data;`.

- `MyClass obj1(10);`:
  - This calls the parameterized constructor to create an object `obj1` with the value 10.

- `MyClass obj2(20);`:
  - This calls the parameterized constructor to create an object `obj2` with the value 20.

- `obj2 = obj1;`:
  - This calls the overloaded assignment operator to assign the value from `obj1` to `obj2`. After the assignment, `obj2` holds a deep copy of `obj1's` data (both objects store the value 10, but in separate memory locations).

- `obj1.display();` and `obj2.display();`:
  - These functions display the values stored in `obj1` and `obj2`. Both display 10, showing that the deep copy worked correctly.

## Key Components of Assignment Operator Overloading

- **Self-assignment Check**:
  Before copying data, the assignment operator must check whether the current object is being assigned to itself. If this check is not included, the object may end up deleting its own data before copying, leading to unexpected behavior.

```cpp
if (this != &obj) {
    // Proceed with copying
}
```

- **Free Existing Resources**:
  The assignment operator must release any previously allocated memory for the object before assigning new data. This prevents memory leaks.

```cpp
delete data;
```

- **Deep Copy**:
  If the class involves dynamic memory allocation, a deep copy must be made to allocate new memory for the destination object and copy the data, ensuring that the two objects do not share the same memory.

```cpp
data = new int(*(obj.data));
```

- **Return `*this`:**
  The assignment operator must return a reference to the current object so that assignment statements can be chained.

```cpp
return *this;
```

## Why Overload the Assignment Operator?

- **Default behavior**: The compiler provides a default assignment operator, which performs a shallow copy. This can cause problems when a class contains pointers to dynamically allocated memory. Both objects will share the same memory, which can lead to memory corruption or double deletion.

- **Deep copy**: Overloading the assignment operator allows you to perform a deep copy, where each object gets its own memory, preventing issues such as memory leaks and undefined behavior.

## Self-assignment Example and the Role of `this` Pointer

The `this` pointer is an implicit parameter passed to member functions. It points to the current object on which the function is operating. In the assignment operator, it is used to check for self-assignment (`this != &obj`). If an object is assigned to itself (e.g., `obj = obj`), no copying should be done.

```cpp
MyClass& operator=(const MyClass &obj) {
    if (this != &obj) {  // Check for self-assignment
        delete data;  // Free existing memory
        data = new int(*(obj.data));  // Perform deep copy
    }
    return *this;  // Return the current object
}
```
