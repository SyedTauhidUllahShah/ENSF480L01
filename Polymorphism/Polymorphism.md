# Detailed Dry Run of C++ Program

### Key Concepts
- **Constructors**: Functions automatically invoked when an object of a class is created. They initialize the object.
- **Destructors**: Functions automatically invoked when an object of a class is destroyed. They handle cleanup, such as releasing memory or other resources.

## Classes Overview
We have three classes in the program: 
1. **Class A** – Represents a base class with a constructor and destructor.
2. **Class B** – Represents another base class with a constructor and destructor.
3. **Class C** – Inherits from both **Class A** and **Class B**, has its own constructor and destructor.

### Inheritance Structure:
- **Class C** inherits from both **Class B** and **Class A**. 
- The inheritance order matters: **C** inherits from **B** first, then from **A**.

This means that:
1. **B**’s constructor will be called before **A**'s constructor.
2. Upon object destruction, **C**'s destructor will be called first, followed by **A**'s destructor, then **B**'s destructor.

## 1. Memory Allocation for Object `obj` of Class C

When `C obj;` is executed, the program allocates memory to create the `obj` object. Memory is allocated for:
- The members of class **C**.
- The members inherited from class **B**.
- The members inherited from class **A**.

Even though there are no specific data members in these classes (in this example), in general, constructors allocate and initialize memory, and destructors handle the cleanup. Since **C** inherits from both **A** and **B**, the memory layout of `obj` is such that the parts of the object corresponding to **B** come first, followed by the parts corresponding to **A**, and finally the part corresponding to **C** itself.

## 2. Object Construction in `main()`

The object `obj` of class **C** is being created, and this triggers the call to constructors. Here’s how the construction sequence works in detail:

### **Constructor of B: Base Class 1** (First Constructor Called)

The first base class to be constructed is **B**, because **C** inherits from **B** first (based on the order in `class C : public B, public A`).

1. **Compiler Step**: The compiler first checks if there’s a base class. If there is, it invokes the base class constructor before invoking the derived class constructor.
   
2. **Memory Allocation**: Memory for the **B** portion of the `obj` object is allocated.

3. **Initialization**: Since **B** has no specific data members in this example, the constructor for **B** only outputs the message:
   ```cpp
   Constructor of B

2. **Flow**: The control flow returns to the constructor of **C**, but before **C** can execute its own constructor body, the next base class A must be constructed.
